    <h1>Molten Lava</h1>
    <img src="ml.jpg" alt="picture of molten lava">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter — be sure to use unsalted butter, so the lava cakes do not end up overly salty. </li>

        <li>    Chocolate — I like using semi-sweet chocolate, but if you prefer dark chocolate, you can use that instead. I recommend using a high-quality baking chocolate bar such as Ghirardelli, so you get the best smooth and melty centers.</li>
            
        <li>   Eggs — this lava cake recipe calls for two eggs and two egg yolks. The extra yolks add ​​richness and creaminess to the texture of the lava. Save the leftover egg whites to make my meringue cookies recipe or my Eton mess recipe.</li>
            
        <li>  Flour — you do not need a lot of flour for these lava cakes. The flour provides structure, but too much will compromise the molten centers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the butter and chopped chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until smooth. Alternatively, place the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring every 30-seconds until melted.Combine the butter and chopped chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until smooth.

        <li> In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until thick and pale yellow.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold together the mixture until well combined</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter into buttered and floured ramekins. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes are firm set, but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and carefully flip it over, inverting the chocolate lava cake onto the plate. Let stand for about 10 seconds, then remove the ramekin to unmold the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with berries, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>    
    </ol>
